# Tip of the Iceberg
## Our Mission
Tip of the Iceberg focuses on spreading awareness on global warming and ice caps melting in an interactive and engaging way. This website includes multiple pages that share important data and statistics on these topics, using up-to-date information that demonstrates the true situation of global warming. We are striving to use data that goes deeper than the “tip of the iceberg”. Our game called “Save the Seal” interactively shares this data by presenting information about global warming to players as they roll through the game!
